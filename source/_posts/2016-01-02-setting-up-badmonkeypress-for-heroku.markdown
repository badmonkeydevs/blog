I set out to setup a basic jekyll (in this case
[Octopress](http://www.http://octopress.org/)) blog for the Bad Monkeys
so that they could share their thoughts on software development,
starting Bad Monkey Software, and progress as we work hard to launch
PRio, our flagship documentation engine.

<!-- more -->

So follow along as we build our company from one to many and hopefully
carve out our place in the ever-changing SaaS development world.  I'll
start by letting you know that the Bad Monkeys will be available shortly
to bring your new SaaS product idea to life.  We have spent countless
hours developing our workflow, templates, and technologies so that we
can build a superior MVP of your product.

We also specialize in automating our process and we _LOVE_ eating our
own dog food.  That means that when you come to us for your project,
you'll get the most streamlined and optimized experience possible.
